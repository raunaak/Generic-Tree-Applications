# Generic-Tree-Applications
This repository is aimed to understand structure of tree and its various applications and learn tree based algorithms</br>
1. Generic Binary Tree Node structure</br>
2. Tree Traversal : preorder, postorder and inorder</br>
3. Applications of tree traversal :
  a. find total number of nodes, height, max width, diameter of tree and max/min element in a tree</br>
  b. print left side view of a tree, all nodes at distance k from root and all ancestors of a tree</br>
  c. check if a tree is a subtree of another tree</br>
  d. Find lowest common ancestor</br>
4. Non recursive stack based traversal</br>
5. Morris Traversal</br>
