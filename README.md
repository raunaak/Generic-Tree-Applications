# Generic-Tree-Applications
This repository is aimed to understand structure of tree and its various applications and learn tree based algorithms</br>
1. Generic Binary Tree Node structure</br>
2. Tree Traversal : preorder, postorder and inorder</br>
3. Applications of tree traversal:</br>
TraversalApplication1.h ----> find total number of nodes, height, max width, diameter of tree and max/min element in a tree</br>
TraversalApplication2.h----> print left side view of a tree(recursive and non recursive), all nodes at distance k from root and all ancestors of a tree</br>
Subtree.h----> check if a tree is a subtree of another tree</br>
LowestCommonAncestor----> Find lowest common ancestor(2 methods)</br>
4. Non recursive stack based traversal</br>
5. Morris Traversal</br>
